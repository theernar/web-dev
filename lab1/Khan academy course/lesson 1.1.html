    <h1> My poem </h1>
    <p> In the greyness
and drizzle of one <br> despondent
dawn unstirred by <br> harbingers
of sunbreak a vulture
perching high on broken
bones of a dead tree
nestled close to his
mate his smooth
bashed-in head, a pebble
on a stem rooted in
a dump of gross
feathers, inclined affectionately
to hers. </p>
