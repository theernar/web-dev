                Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), typically having a stout body and a large mouth.
                They can be quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are not uncommon.
            </p>

            <p><span class="first-sentence">...mouth.</span>...</p>

            <p>
                Their mouths and gills form a powerful sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance.
                They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters under big rocks.
