    <h1> My poem </h1>
    <p> In the greyness
and drizzle of one <br> despondent
dawn unstirred by <br> harbingers
of sunbreak a vulture
perching high on broken
bones of a dead tree
nestled close to his
mate his smooth
bashed-in head, a pebble
on a stem rooted in
a dump of gross
feathers, inclined affectionately
to hers. </p>

        <strong>Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra. </strong> <br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        <em>And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us. </em> <br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        <em> It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet. </em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong> You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything. </strong>
